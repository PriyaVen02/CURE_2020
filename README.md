# Electronic Lab Notebook Survey Report

Most times, research misconduct is obvious when scientists don't release their dataset, and all the actual findings of the experiments are kept private. This makes it difficult for young researchers to get started in a relatively new field. Electronic lab notebooks are digital versions of paper notes that professional scientists or engineers use to record data and procedures they follow in a lab setting. The main focus of my research is to overcome the data accessibility or reproducibility crisis with the help of electronic lab notebooks. Here is a qualtrics survey I conducted to gather information on the best and worst aspects of these electronic lab notebooks from professional researchers in addition to their opinion on it being a better alternative to paper notes.
The survey report includes responses from scientists of different levels of expertise from across the globe. The graphs were helpful in analysing the data which in turn, helped to gather opinion on whether the use of electronic lab notebooks are a much better alternative for data reproducibility and accessibility as compared to the traditional paper journals.
